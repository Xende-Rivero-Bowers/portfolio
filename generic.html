									   This is the game I made for my <i>Multimedia and Game Development</i> module at Durham University.
									   The game was coded using C# and made in Unity, taking approximately a month to make. I received a 
									   First for the game, receiving particular praise for my game flow and my implementation of the various
									   game mechanics.</p><p>
									   It is the first game I made, so I learned a lot about the development process as I went along.
									   I had to make a game from several prompts, so I decided to make a turn-based RPG about a kitten
									   exploring a dungeon, taking influence from games like Omori and Ib. Turn-based RPGs have always been 
									   one of my favourite types of games, so I enjoyed being able to use the techniques I found interesting
									   in these games and apply them to my own. In particular, I was fascinated by how games like Undertale
									   or Omori used their simple graphics to create an atmosphere that heightened the emotions the player felt
									   instead of diminishing them. Another influence the games left on me was their use of surreal and 
									   abstract imagery, which I used at the end of the game where I had some room to experiment.

								<div class="leftcontainer">
									<p align="left"><span class="image left"><img src="images/game_sewer.png" alt="" /></span>
									I wanted Assassin's Kitten to take 30-45 minutes to complete while containing a fair amount of levels,
									so I designed each level to take 5-10 minutes to finish, depending on how much exploring the player
									wanted to do. 
									There are four main levels (not including the final area and the hub world): The Dungeon,
									the Sewer, the Tomb and the Depths. Each level has a unique design: The Dungeon
									is a long corridor with plenty of optional rooms, the Sewer is a series of narrow twisting tunnels,
									the Tomb is a wide-open plain, and the Depths is a maze of identical rooms. Each level has it's own
									enemies to fight, with a boss at the end that must be defeated in order to unlock the next level.
									While it's possible to go straight to the key that unlocks the boss on each level, I designed it
									so that the player would need to do a decent amount of exploring in order to have a good chance of 
									beating the boss. Exploring rewards the player with new weapons, healing potions and chests that 
									contain gold.

								<h2 align="center"><b>Battle system</b></h2>
								<div class="leftcontainer">
									<p align="left"><span class="image right"><img src="images/game_battle.png" alt="" /></span>
									Since I made the game in Unity instead of an engine like RPGMaker, I had to design the battle system
									from scratch, which required setting up a unique battle screen that needed different mechanics to 
									every other screen in the game. The battle system is a standard rpg battle system, where the player
									can either attack an enemy, use an item (such as switch their weapon or drink a potion), or run away.
									I added my own unique element to the battle system by giving each weapon five properties: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>STRENGTH (which is the weapon's maximum damage)</li>
										<li>RELIABILITY (which is the weapon's minimum damage)</li>
										<li>ACCURACY (which is the chance of scoring a critical hit)</li>
										<li>SPEED (which is the chance the weapon doesn't miss)</li>
										<li>DEFENSE (which determines how much the weapon reduces any damage to the player)</li>
									</ul>
									<p align="left"><span class="image left"><img src="images/game_hell.png" alt="" /></span>
									I used my background in mathematics to design each weapon so that each one had certain properties that they did
									better and worse than others, so that the player had a wide variety of options to use without having
									to specifically rely on one or two weapons in particular. For example, the warhammer has high STRENGTH
									and RELIABILITY but low SPEED, meaning it does high average damage but has a higher chance of missing.
									In contrast, the crossbow has moderate STRENGTH and high DEFENSE, so it does less damage but also 
									allows the player to take more hits. In addition, I added a few Elite weapons that could be found in the later 
									levels for the player to use, such as the Moon Bow, which gives the player a much higher chance of a critical
									hit than any other weapon.
									</p>

							<h2 align="center"><b>Levelling up</b></h2>
							<div class="leftcontainer">
								<p align="left"><span class="image right"><img src="images/game_hub.png" alt="" /></span>
								The most important part of the game design was the flow as the player progressed. I wanted the player
								to be able to level up enough to complete each level by playing normally (i.e. finding the key and proceeding
								to the boss without investigating all the side areas scattered across the level).
								The main elements of this were the player level and the weapon level. Levelling up the player
								grants them more health, which is achieved by killing enemies, with higher-level enemies 
								granting more XP. I designed the game so that the player would level up two or three times per level 
								if they proceeded normally, while they would level up four to five times per level if they took 
								the time to explore. The player has a maximum level of 20, so more thorough players would be able 
								to reach maximum level by the time they finished.   
								</p>
								<p align="left">
								The other aspect of levelling up was the weapon level system. Each weapon has five levels, which changes
								their STRENGTH and RELIABILITY, giving them higher maximum and minimum damage. Levelling up the players
								weapons can be done at the blacksmith, as long as the player has enough money. The aim was to have the 
								player upgrade their weapon once per level, with normal weapons costing less to upgrade than Elite weapons,
								which could only be upgraded by the player grinding enemies. In addition, I added a shopkeeper so the player
								had the choice of buying the weapons instead of searching the levels for them, though I made the prices 
								expensive enough that the player would be encouraged to explore first. The last touch I made was to make it
								so that if a player got rid of a weapon and then added it again, they would keep their upgrades, in order
								to allow the player to experiment with their inventory without having to grind.

								<h2 align="center"><b>Project management</b></h2>
								<div class="leftcontainer">
									<p align="left"><span class="image left"><img src="images/game_final.png" alt="" /></span>
									The deadline for building the game was approximately a month, which meant I had to create a detailed plan, since turn-based
									RPGs are hard to build in Unity. I started by sketching out the basic concept and creating the levels
									before I started working on the battle system. Designing the battle mode from scratch was the hardest 
									part of the project, but once I had done it I was able to create and make data for all the various enemies.
									I wasn't satisfied with the simple combat system, which is when I added the weapon system. Once I hade done 
									this, I had to redo most of the enemies data to take into account different weapons. After a lot of 
									testing I had a level progression system I was satisfied with, so in the last week I added the shop to 
									allow the player to buy weapons, though I also added some scattered around the levels that the player could
									find. I also added music to the game and redesigned the starting weapon (the Assassin's Knife) to be undroppable, 
									to avoid a situation where the player got rid of all their weapons and couldn't progress. Since I had a bit of spare time left
									before the deadline, I ended by adding some NPCs to explain how the various systems worked and a chart that
									allowed the player to see the strengths and weaknesses of each item.<br>
									I got a First in the module, receiving particular praise for the flow of my game and the implementation of
									the various mechanics.
